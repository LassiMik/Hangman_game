# Hangman game

This is a stundent project hangman game. I chose to make a hangman game because I thought it would be fun to code with react. I utilized TypeScript with React to make this game. 

I chose to use Vite over Create-React-App for its inbuilt support for tsx. Making this project I learnt a lot about using TypeScript aswell as conditional rendering in react.

## Introduction

This is a learning project in which I wanted to learn how to use TypeScript as it was one of our course subjects.

## Used technologies

I have utilized the following technologies to make this project

[x] React

[x] TypeScript

[x] Vite

## Summary

This project has made me to study one of this courses subjects, TypeScript more deeply. 

During this project I learnt how to make TypeScript types such as this type for the Popup component
```
type PopupProps = {
correctLetters: boolean
wrongLetters: string[]
selectedWord: string
playAgain: () => void
}
```
So when a react component receives props TypeScript knows what type those props are
